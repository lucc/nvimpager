# NAME

nvimpager - using neovim as a pager

# SYNOPSIS

**nvimpager** [*-acp*] [\--] [nvim options and files] \
**nvimpager** *-h* \
**nvimpager** *-v*

# DESCRIPTION

Nvimpager is a small program that can be used like most other pagers.
Internally it uses neovim with the default TUI to display the text. This means
it has all the fancy syntax highlighting, mouse support and other features of
neovim available in the pager, possibly including plugins!

# OPTIONS

Nvimpager itself interprets only very few options but all neovim options can
also be specified.  If options to neovim are specified before the first file
name they must be preceded by "\--" to prevent nvimpager from trying to
interpret them.

The following options are interpreted by nvimpager itself:

-a
: run in "auto mode" (default).  Auto mode will detect the terminal size and
switch to pager mode if the content to display would not fit on one screen.  If
the content will fit on one screen it will switch to cat mode. This overrides
any previous *-c* and *-p* options.

-c
: run in "cat mode".  Do not start the neovim TUI, only use neovim for syntax
highlighting and print the result to stdout. This overrides any previous *-a*
and *-p* options.

-h
: show the help screen and exit

-n
: number all output lines

-p
: run in "pager mode".  Start the neovim TUI to display the given content. This
overrides any previous *-a* and *-c* options.

-v
: show version information and exit

# CONFIGURATION

Like neovim itself nvimpager will honour `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and
`$XDG_DATA_HOME`, which default to `~/.config` and `~/.local` respectively.
The main config directory is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvimpager` and the main user
config file is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvimpager/init.vim`.  The site directory is
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/.local/share/nvimpager/site`.  The manifest for remote plugins
is read from (and written to) `$XDG_DATA_HOME/nvimpager/rplugin.vim`.

The rest of the `&runtimepath` is configured like for neovim.  The `-u` option
of *nvim*(1) itself can be used to change the main config file from the command
line.

The default config files for neovim are not used by design as these
potentially load many plugins and do a lot of configuration that is only
relevant for editing.  If one really wants to use the same config files for
both nvimpager and nvim it is possible to do so by symlinking the config and
site directories and the rplugin file.

The environment variable `$NVIM` can be used to specify an nvim executable to
use.  If unset it defaults to `nvim`.

# EXAMPLES

To use nvimpager to view a file (with neovim's syntax highlighting if the
filetype is detected):

```sh
nvimpager file
```

Pipe text into nvimpager to view it:

```sh
echo text | nvimpager
```

Use nvimpager as your default \$PAGER to view man pages or git diffs:

```sh
export PAGER=nvimpager
man nvimpager
git diff
```
